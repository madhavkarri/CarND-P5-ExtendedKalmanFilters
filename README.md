Overview

Implement an Extened Kalman Filter in C++. Using simulated lidar and radar measurements of the bicycle, that travels around the car, track the bicycle's position and velocity using Kalman filter, lidar measurements, and radar measurements.

Data File for EKF project

Explanation of the Data File

The github repo contains one data file:

- `obj_pose-laser-radar-synthetic-input.txt`

A screenshot of the first data file:

The simulator will be using this data file, and feed `main.cpp` values from it one line at a time.

Each row represents a sensor measurement, where the first column lists source of measurement: radar (R) or lidar (L).

For a row containing radar data, the columns are: `sensor_type`, `rho_measured`, `phi_measured`, `rhodot_measured`, `timestamp`, `x_groundtruth`, `y_groundtruth`, `vx_groundtruth`, `vy_groundtruth`, `yaw_groundtruth`, `yawrate_groundtruth`.

For a row containing lidar data, the columns are: `sensor_type`, `x_measured`, `y_measured`, `timestamp`, `x_groundtruth`, `y_groundtruth`, `vx_groundtruth`, `vy_groundtruth`, `yaw_groundtruth`, `yawrate_groundtruth`.

Whereas radar has three measurements `(rho, phi, rhodot)`, lidar has two measurements `(x, y)`.

Use measurement values and timestamp inside Kalman filter algorithm. Groundtruth, which represents the actual path the bicycle took, is for calculating `root mean squared error (RMSE)`.

Ignore yaw and yaw rate ground truth values.


Reading in the Data

A wrapper code was provided to read in and parse the data. This code is in the `main.cpp` file. The `main.cpp` file creates instances of a `MeasurementPackage`.

Inside `main.cpp`, wrapper code would be something similar to as shown below:
```
MeasurementPackage meas_package;
meas_package.sensor_type_ = MeasurementPackage::LASER;
meas_package.raw_measurements_ = VectorXd(2);
meas_package.raw_measurements_ << px, py;
meas_package.timestamp_ = timestamp;
```
and
```
vector<VectorXd> ground_truth;
VectorXd gt_values(4);
gt_values(0) = x_gt;
gt_values(1) = y_gt; 
gt_values(2) = vx_gt;
gt_values(3) = vy_gt;
ground_truth.push_back(gt_values);
```
The code reads in the data file line by line. The measurement data for each line gets pushed onto a `measurement_pack_list`. The ground truth `[p_x, p_y, v_x, v_y]` for each line in the data file gets pushed onto `ground_truth` so RMSE can be calculated later from `tools.cpp`.

File Structure

Overview of a Kalman Filter: Initialize, Predict, Update

Three main steps for programming a Kalman filter:
- `Initialize` Kalman filter variables
- `Predict` object location/position after a time step of Î”t
- `Update` object location/position based on sensor measurements

The prediction and update steps are called recursively in a loop

To measure how well Kalman filter performs, `RMSE` is calculated by comparing Kalman filter results with the ground truth.

The three steps (initialize, predict, update) plus calculating RMSE encapsulate the entire extended Kalman filter project.
